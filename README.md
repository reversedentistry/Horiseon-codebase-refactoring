# Refactoring Website Code for Better Accessibility 

## Introduction

Accessibility has been a growing concern in our day to day lives, none moreso than the online space. Coding languages like HTML have evolved to reflect this need to provide better experiences for those who use screen readers as well as giving search engines an easier time when looking for relevant search results. This means that *how* developers build websites is just as crucial as the website itself. 

## Description
A marketing agency presents their website code for refactoring. They ask that it be changed to be better match accessibility standards and to improve its search engine optimization. As a result, elements within the HTML were altered to semantic HTML elements, and its respective CSS file edited to correspond with the new elements. Following Scout Rule courtesies, other parts of the HTML unrelated to accessibility were also revised and improved such as fixing hyperlinks within the page. The CSS file was also revised to be cleaner by consolidating the appropriate elements with identical styles, and comments are provided on the changes on the file. 

## Technology 
Languages used:
